Common business framework to manage renting some resources. Inspired by some problems with rehearsal process for my amateur rock band :)

## FEATURES

* Creating free-structured resources based on custom data scheme or proposed templates
* Subscribing to own or other's resources
* Planning resource by your own or delegated to you to manage
* Placing order for resource, which could be confirmed by resource moderator
* Building detailed schedule/calendar for selected set of resources
* Make own domain with users and resources (kinda milti-tenant ability, like slack workspaces)
* Resource claiming could have different rent options, specific for certain resource (how many person will participate
  or how much equipment will be utilized, so the rent cost might differ)
